# 🛠️ Log Analysis with Python & Linux (Beginner Project)

This is my first hands-on Linux-based Python project. The script reads system log files (like `/var/log/syslog`) and summarizes how many times different types of errors appear.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The aim was to:
- Get comfortable using the Linux terminal (Ubuntu)
- Use the Nano text editor to write scripts
- Learn to work with system log files
- Parse logs using basic Python
- Build confidence with file handling and CLI tools

## 🧠 What the Script Does

- Opens a system log file
- Converts all lines to lowercase
- Searches for keywords like `error`, `fail`, `warning`, etc.
- Counts how many times each appears using `collections.Counter`
- Displays a clean summary
